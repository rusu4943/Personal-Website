                    <h3>Explainable Artificial Intelligence Architecture for Melanoma Diagnosis Using Indicator Localization and Self-Supervised Learning</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Melanoma is a prevalent lethal type of cancer that is treatable if diagnosed at an early stage of development. Skin lesions
                        are a typical indicator for diagnosing melanoma, but they often lead to delayed diagnosis due to the high similarities between
                        cancerous and benign lesions at the early stages of melanoma. Deep learning (DL) can be used as a solution to classify skin
                        lesion pictures with a high accuracy, but clinical adoption of DL faces a significant challenge. The reason is that the decision
                        processes of DL models are often uninterpretable which makes them “black boxes” that are challenging to trust. This research
                        develops an explainable DL architecture for melanoma diagnosis which generates clinically interpretable visual explanations for
                        its decisions. The research experiments demonstrate that our proposed architectures match clinical explanations significantly
                        better than existing architectures</p>

                    <p> The image displayed below specifically illustrates Milia-like cysts, which are round, whitish or yellowish structures commonly observed in seborrheic keratosis under non-polarized dermoscopy. In the column labeled "Bio-unet", you can see the results generated by our framework. Notably, our framework demonstrates enhanced precision and accuracy, particularly in highlighting the areas of interest identified by experts in the field. This level of detailed attention underscores the effectiveness of our approach in focusing on critical regions within the dermatological imagery. </p>

                    <p> The image below provides a detailed view of the "negative pigment network," a distinctive dermatological feature also known as the reverse or inverse network. This network is characterized by its unique configuration where relatively lighter areas form the apparent grid, and relatively darker areas fill the apparent "holes" of the network. This inverse relationship between the grid and the holes is a key identifier in dermatological imaging, offering insights into specific skin conditions. The precision of our framework in capturing and highlighting these intricate patterns of the negative pigment network demonstrates its effectiveness. It adeptly focuses on these critical areas, providing an invaluable tool for dermatological analysis and diagnosis, particularly in identifying subtle nuances that are vital for accurate skin condition assessments. </p>

                    <br><br><br>
                    <p> The featured image below highlights 'streaks,' a critical dermatological characteristic often observed at the periphery of melanocytic lesions. Streaks manifest as linear pigmented projections and can take forms such as radial streaming (lineal streaks) and pseudopods (bulbous projections). From a histological perspective, these streaks are indicative of the radial growth phase of a melanocytic tumor, where junctional nests of pigmented melanocytes are found confluent at the lesion's periphery. This distinct pattern is not only a hallmark of certain melanocytic tumors but also carries significant diagnostic implications. For example, a symmetrical distribution of streaks typically suggests a diagnosis of a spindle cell nevus (Spitz/Reed nevus). In contrast, an asymmetrical pattern may necessitate the exclusion of superficial spreading melanoma. This ability of our framework to accurately capture and delineate these streaks in melanocytic lesions is a testament to its precision and utility in dermatological analysis, aiding significantly in the accurate diagnosis and assessment of skin conditions. </p>

                    <h3>Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on 3D Medical Images</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>In medical imaging, the heterogeneity of data across different domains poses a significant challenge for deploying robust machine
                        learning models. Our study addresses this issue through a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) strategy for 3D
                        medical images. This method innovatively replaces the need for actual source data with Gaussian samples, circumventing privacy
                        constraints and data availability issues. Our approach has shown promising results in maintaining high model performance when
                        applied to target domains, without access to original source data, marking a step forward in privacy-preserving machine learning
                        in healthcare.</p>
